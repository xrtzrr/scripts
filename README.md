# EXPLANATION TO ALL MY SCRIPTS
So, I created this github for my own script storage (Some scripts may not be owned/made by me).
This is my first ever github repository, so if I fucked up something, please don't hesitate to tell me.
Since this is my own script storage repos, I will still [allow / make it public] for people to see it if they need a script for anything.
Hope you can find something useful or some code to learn with for future reference?!
For now that's sort of.. it, i guess.. I will be updating this alot though when I have freetime to do so.
